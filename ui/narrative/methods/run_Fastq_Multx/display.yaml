   <p>This method demultiplexes a reads library into a reads set using the FASTQ-MULTX program in the ea-utils package: https://expressionanalysis.github.io/ea-utils/</p>

   <p>fastq-multx - Demultiplexes a fastq. Capable of auto-determining barcode id's based on a master set fields. Keeps multiple reads in-sync during demultiplexing. Can verify that the reads are in-sync as well, and fail if they're not.</p>
